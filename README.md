Hi, I'm Szabolcs Hulvej, you can find me as [@szabixd](https://github.com/szabixd). ‚ù§

My main area of interest is the Frontend Design part, which of course is the first thing the user encounters. I deal with frontend design in C# WPF(Windows Presentation Foundation) applications and websites, i.e. HTML. I also integrate Javascript and CSS animations and other functions and adapt them to code. Some of my works can be viewed on my website in Public Repositorys. 

Take a look at it. ‚ù§

My first major project is "ByteBag", which we are working on with [@csuszy.](https://github.com/csuszy).


Repository for it can be found here: ~ [ByteBag](https://github.com/csuszy/ByteBag/tree/main) üõ†
